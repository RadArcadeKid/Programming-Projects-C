## ABOUT QT + What this is 
These Projects were large homework assignments designed for a software known as QT: CREATOR, a C++ Application Development Tool. 
They will **only run** if built + ran in the QT environment engine, and are not executable files (yet). They can be 

* **HW4** - Life - This is a fully-fledged application of *Conway's Game of Life*, which simulates cells in an evnironment. This program 
draws the cells using QGraphics items and will update/change based on time and how many times the user "steps" forward. The player can also
use a slider to adjust the speed. The game will change color over time, and the graph populates the population. 

* **HW5** - Advanced Connect Four - This is a game of Connect Four that I created, designed, and developed for my final project. Players
alternate between turns in a standard game of *Connect Four*, however, they also have powerups and special converter pieces they can use!!
This was perhaps the largest and most in-depth C++ project I've ever done. It features various design patterns including: 
   * Object Oriented Design
   * Object Inheritence
   * Event-based programming via QT 
   * Complex layers of pointers and objectification
   * Static variables + functions
   * Vectors, Arrays
