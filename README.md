# C++ Programming Projects 
This repo is a showcase of various in-class and out-of-class in C++ programming projects for an upper-division University of Colorado Boulder computer science programming class. I'm making this public to showcase my C++ skills, as well as use of design patterns + good commenting throughout. Please feel free to run and compile these projects if you'd like to see them in action. 


**The bast showcases of my work are in the HW1, HW2, HW3, and QT directories.**
Please note the use of comments, and good C++ design pracitices throughout. Most of these were learning exercises, but they took me a lot of hard work and a long time to figure out. 


*(I've expunged the name + details of the assignments, as well as some personal info from all the code this repo. This so that other people currently taking the class won't plagerize and/or steal my code.)*
